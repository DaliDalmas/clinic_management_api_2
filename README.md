# clinic_management_api_2

This is the second version of clinic management API. Here I implement user authentication using Simple JWT.

## WHAT I LEARNT

- Working with relationships in django rest framework (This took me alot of time to serialize)
- Implementing the endpoints in Swagger
- Using JWT for authentication
